how branching is done creation of different branches with merging them to the main branch
There are different commands through which we can add file and commit them using git commands

Now we have a total of 4 branches including 2 feature branches one git branch and one bug fix branch in this way we merge with the main branch and push the branches to the upstream from downstream 
up stream is the remote branch we create in the git repo and down stream is from the locsl terminal
in this way we push n pull the branches in github.
