How Branching Is Done Creation Of Different Branches With Merging Them To The Main Branch
There are different commands through which we can add file and commit them using git commands

Now we have a total of 6 branches including 2 feature branches one git branch and one bug fix branch in this way we merge with the main branch and push the branches to the upstream from downstream
up stream is the remote branch we create in the git repo and down stream is from the local terminal
in this way we push n pull the branches in github.

We can commit both from the upstream and from the downstream the only difference which is created is that we need to directly commit in the upstream using UI whereas in downstream we need to manaually commit using the commands like(push,pull,commit etc)
